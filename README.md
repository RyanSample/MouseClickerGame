MouseClickerGame
================

Game "randomly" pops a button onto the terminal screen. Clicking on the button will add a point to the score and the button will disappear after 3 seconds. This game creates four child processes who each take a button, while the parent process registers mouse clicks.


*future development needs to add resizing of the terminal window in case the user accidentally hits the edge and drags the window
*-this bug causes an error which eventually causes what may be a crash.
